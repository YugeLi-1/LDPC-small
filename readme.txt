function :This paper is just a pipeline decoding algorithm for small LDPC matrix. The size of 
                the matrix is 20 * 10, and the input data is within 50 groups. At present, it can 
                correct about 3 bits. The simulation with Modelsim software is only a rough  
                semi-finished product, and many of them are not optimized.
